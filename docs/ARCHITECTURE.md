# 🏛️ Market Analytics Platform Architecture

## 🧠 Overview

The Market Analytics Platform is a modular, config-driven data engineering system designed to extract, process, and analyze cryptocurrency market data.

The platform follows a declarative architecture where pipeline behavior is defined through structured JSON configurations, validated against strict schemas, and executed through a custom-built orchestration engine.

The system is designed with clear separation of concerns between execution, data extraction, and data loading, enabling extensibility, maintainability, and scalability.

## 🎯 Observability and Reporting

The platform generates pipeline observability and reporting assets from execution metadata.

- Run execution history for the ingestion pipeline
- Pipeline performance and runtime SLO reporting

These assets are surfaced through a dbt project that consumes BigQuery-loaded pipeline metadata.

## ⚙️ Core System Components

### 1. Execution Engine

The execution engine is responsible for orchestrating pipeline runs. It loads job configurations, validates them against schemas, triggers execution commands, and manages run lifecycle tracking.

👉 [Deep dive](core/EXECUTION_ENGINE.md)

---

### 2. Configuration System

The system uses declarative JSON-based job configurations to define pipeline behavior, enabling flexible and reusable pipeline definitions.

👉 [Deep dive](core/CONFIG_SYSTEM.md)

---

### 3. Schema Validation Layer

All job configurations are validated against a predefined JSON schema to enforce structural consistency and prevent runtime errors.

👉 [Deep dive](core/SCHEMA_VALIDATION.md)

---

### 4. Destination Engine

The destination engine processes extracted data and writes it to Google Cloud Storage in optimized Parquet format.

👉 [Deep dive](core/DESTINATION_ENGINE.md)

---

### 5. Run Tracking & Observability

Pipeline executions are tracked in a metadata database, capturing execution status, timestamps, and error information for monitoring and debugging.

👉 [Deep dive](core/RUN_TRACKING.md)

---

## 🛠️ Data Pipeline Layers

### 1. Data Lake Layer

Raw data is stored in a partitioned and optimized format for efficient storage and retrieval.

👉 [Deep dive](layers/DATA_LAKE.md)

---

### 2. Data Warehouse Layer

The architecture is designed to support future warehouse layering, while current dbt work is focused on pipeline metadata observability, SLO reporting and monitoring.
